This shifts her power budget toward flanking and 1v1 potential, making her stronger in isolated engagements but slightly weaker in frontline scenarios where she can\'t rely as heavily on sustained healing."}]},"abilities":[{"category":"primary","key":"M1","name":"Cyber-Web Cluster","icon":"Cyber-Web_Cluster_Icon.png","details":["Launch forward a Cyber-Web Cluster (Rapid-fire, delayed projectile)","Damage: 15 (projectile & spell field)","Fire Rate: 3.33 rounds/s","Range: 1.5m spherical radius","Projectile Speed: 120m/s","Can deal critical damage (headshot)","Firing Movement Speed Penalty: 20%"],"changes":[{"description":"Faster projectile convergence from shoulders to avoid missing close-range enemies","impact":"balanced","comment":"Shooting in this game feels awkward because projectiles originate from the character\'s body before converging toward the crosshair. This is especially problematic for Peni, as she fires from both shoulders. When aiming at the same spot, her shots may hit or miss inconsistently. To compensate, I believe her projectile convergence should be stronger"}]},{"category":"secondary","key":"M2","name":"Cyber-Web Snare","icon":"Cyber-Web_Snare_Icon.png","details":["Cast futuristic webbing that Immobilizes enemies or creates a Cyber-Web","Damage: 5","Cooldown: 3s","Range: 3m spherical radius","Projectile Speed: 60m/s","Enemies hit are ensnared for 0.7s"],"changes":[{"description":"Snare only ends if the enemy is touching the ground","impact":"strong","comment":"While Peni shouldn\'t counter aerial heroes, landing her slow-moving M2 projectile on them should be properly rewarding. This change specifically compensates for the difficulty of hitting airborne targets, without significantly affecting other scenarios where targets would naturally hit the ground quickly anyway."}]},{"category":"ability","key":"Shift","name":"Bionic Spider-Nest","icon":"Bionic_Spider-Nest_Icon.png","details":["Generate a Spider-Nest at targeted area","Periodically spawns Spider-Drones (40 damage each)","Creates Cyber-Webs around its location","Cooldown: 15s (shorter if not destroyed)","Spawn Interval: Two Spider-Drones every 3s","Range: 12m spherical radius","Maximum Distance: 10m","Ability Health: 350","While in Cyber-Web: Healing Over Time + Movement Boost"],"changes":[{"description":"Make Spider-Drones track enemies near webs (not just on contact) while maintaining damage-only-on-contact behavior","impact":"balanced","comment":"Currently, drones only react when enemies directly touch webs, often appearing unresponsive to nearby jumping targets. This change makes them proactively approach enemies near webs (without dealing damage prematurely), creating smarter zone control while preserving the touch requirement for actual damage."}]},{"category":"ability","key":"E","name":"Arachno-Mine","icon":"Arachno-Mine_Icon.png","details":["Deploy spider-shaped mines that can be concealed in Cyber-Webs","Damage: 100 per mine","Charges: 4","Cooldown: 4s per charge","Range: 3m spherical radius","Invisible when placed in Cyber-Webs","Automatically lock-on enemies stepping on the web"],"changes":[{"description":"Allow holding button to deploy all mines at once","impact":"weak","comment":"Quality-of-life change inspired by Hulk\'s jump mechanic. Holding the button lets you position during fights before unleashing all mines in one devastating burst - perfect for surprise traps and quick zone control."}]},{"category":"ability","key":"F","name":"Cyber-Bond","icon":"Cyber-Bond_Icon.png","details":["Shoot a web strand that pulls Peni to targeted area or Cyber-Web","Cooldown: 3s","Range: 19m maximum distance (10m pullback range)","Projectile Speed: 100m/s","Creates a Cyber-Web at impact location","One of the fastest movement tools for Vanguards"],"changes":[{"description":"Improve Cyber-Bond reliability by implementing position correction during dash and Tether-Bond","impact":"Balanced","comment":"Currently, Cyber-Bond breaks when environmental collision interrupts the dash or Tether-Bond path. The solution should: 1) Attempt to push Peni to the intended endpoint via path correction 2) Only cancel if completely blocked 3) Never use the current unreliable break behavior. This maintains mobility flow while preventing unfair failures."},{"description":"Add hold-button toggle to disable automatic web attachment for Cyber-Bond","impact":"weak","comment":"While high-level Peni players rarely use the automatic web attachment feature, it shouldn\'t be removed as it enables potential future teamplay combos. This optional toggle prevents accidental attachments during normal gameplay while preserving the mechanic for strategic(lobby bungie jumping) use cases."},{"description":"Enable web zone passive effects during Cyber-Bond traversal","impact":"balanced"},{"description":"Restrict tether break conditions to: (a) Hard CC beyond 12m (b) Player-initiated release","comment":"It\'s counter-intuitive that the tether doesn\'t provide web bonuses when Peni is clearly connected to her own web. These changes: 1) Reward web-based mobility with proper buffs 2) Make the tether more reliable by preventing arbitrary breaks 3) Maintain the \'bungee jump\' fantasy while making it actually practical to use."},{"description":"Cyber-Bond web doesn\'t count toward web limit","impact":"OP","comment":"I should say THIS ONE - even with the headshot reduction changes - THIS ONE is the big one. Peni mains will easily understand how this change could redefine everything. This makes nest paths much more controllable, enabling easy flanking while maintaining set nests, as the M2 web limit becomes the only one you need to manage strategically. This change also means you are slower to set fast nest setups but atleast for me it\'s preferably"}]},{"category":"ability","key":"Space","name":"Wall Crawl","icon":"Wall_Crawl_PP_Icon.png","details":["Hold Jump to crawl on vertical surfaces (90° angle only)","Movement Speed: 7.2m/s","Cannot freely wall crawl like Spider-Man/Venom"],"changes":[{"description":"Allow Peni to move right or left while wallcrawling","impact":"balanced","comment":"She\'s the only Spider character with such a janky wall mechanic that it feels like ass. Balance-wise, this won\'t change much since Peni mostly uses wallcrawl for high ground, unlike Spider-Man or Venom who rely on it for positioning engages or hiding. Plus, this is mainly for those BS moments when a wall ledge is like one centimeter off the right spot."},{"description":"Allow shooting/deploying mines while stationary on walls","impact":"weak","comment":"Wall-crawling currently feels restrictive when stationary. Enabling combat actions in this state would: 1) Reward creative positioning 2) Make wall-play more viable 3) Add depth to Peni\'s mobility options."}]},{"category":"ability","key":"Q","name":"Spider-Sweeper","icon":"Spider-Sweeper_Icon.png","details":["Ultimate Ability - Enhances the SP//dr suit","Damage: 60 per sweep attack (launches enemies upwards)","Grants 450 Bonus Health and 70% Movement Boost","Automatically deploys Arachno-Mines (7 ammo) and Spider-Drones","Attack Interval: 1s (sweep), 0.7s (Arachno-Mines/Spider-Drones)","Duration: 12 seconds","Energy Cost: 3400","Sweep Range: 5m","Spider-Drone Range: 4m radius"],"changes":[{"description":"Make Peni unstoppable during ultimate startup animation","impact":"balanced","comment":"Currently, Peni is the only transformation-based ultimate that remains fully vulnerable during its long startup. Characters like Hulk become INVULNERABLE when transforming (outside of bonus health), while Peni can be interrupted and lose her entire ult shield from a single hit. The only \'advantage\' she has is slight movement during the animation, but getting canceled feels like absolute bullshit—unlike Scarlet Witch’s ult, which is at least understandable and fair to counter. Since Peni’s ult isn’t instant and requires setup to be effective, getting knocked out of it before anything happens just makes you go *\'Wow, that’s fucking stupid.\'* This change ensures her ult isn’t invalidated by random stuns."},{"description":"Hitting enemies with Spider Sweep grants 75 shield","impact":"balanced","comment":"This change incentivizes using M1 during Peni’s ultimate, which currently has little value due to its low damage and the fact that she often becomes *more* vulnerable while ulting. The shield reward compensates for the risk, making her ult less of a \'lose condition\' and adding an offensive/defensive layer where players must decide between aggression and survival."},{"description":"Allow earlier ultimate cancellation","impact":"balanced","comment":"Peni’s ultimate isn’t universally strong—it’s situational, and there are many cases where her base kit (which is highly versatile and reliable) is simply better. This change gives players more control, letting them opt out early if the ult isn’t working out, or even just using it briefly to grab bonus mines before canceling. It opens up flexibility instead of forcing a commitment to an underwhelming transformation."}]}]}')}}]);
